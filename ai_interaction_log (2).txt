AI Interaction Log

Initial Prompt:
I asked AI: "hey chat gpt my teacher gave me an assignment and i have to submit it until friday he told me to use ai and he also want to take an interview regarding how i used ai .....this assignment is on programming AI-Guided Shopping List Manager Assignment"

AI Response:
AI explained the assignment requirements step by step and told me what files I need to prepare: messy_shopping.ipynb, clean_shopping.ipynb, code_evolution_analysis.txt, and ai_interaction_log.txt.

Refined Prompts:
- I asked AI to give me messy beginner-style code for the shopping list program.
- I then asked for a clean, professional version of the same code.
- I asked AI to write a simple and brief analysis that I can easily explain to my teacher.
- Finally, I asked AI to create the txt files for submission.

What I Used:
- I used the messy code as my first version (messy_shopping.ipynb).
- I used the clean code as my improved version (clean_shopping.ipynb).
- I used the simple analysis for code_evolution_analysis.txt.
- I am now using this log for ai_interaction_log.txt.

What I Did Not Use:
- AI gave some long explanations that I did not copy, because I wanted shorter and simple text to explain easily in class.

Verification:
- I ran the programs in Google Colab to make sure they worked.
- I tested adding, viewing, removing, and counting items to confirm both programs behaved the same way.

Challenges:
- The biggest challenge was that I was not allowed to use Python lists or functions, so I asked AI to help me store items in separate variables (slot1, slot2, etc.).
- At first the messy code looked too confusing, so I asked AI to explain the differences in simple words.

Summary:
I used AI as a guide to build both versions of the program. I improved my understanding of coding style, readability, and professional practices. I made sure to understand each line of the code so I can explain it to my teacher during the interview.
