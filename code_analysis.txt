Simple Code Analysis

1. Variable Names
- Messy code uses names like item1, item2, item3 without explaining what they mean.
- Clean code uses names like slot1, total_items, and program_running, which are easier to understand.
- This makes it clear what each variable does.

2. Comments
- Messy version has no comments, so another person reading the code might get confused.
- Clean version has helpful comments before each section (like "Add item" or "Remove item") so it’s easy to follow.

3. Readability
- Messy code looks crowded, with no spacing between sections.
- Clean code is organized with spaces, headings, and clear structure.
- This makes the program easier to read and explain.

4. User Feedback
- Messy version just prints items with little explanation.
- Clean version gives clearer messages like “⚠️ Your shopping list is full” or “Milk removed.”
- This improves the user experience.

5. Professional Style
- Both programs work the same, but the clean code looks more professional and is easier to maintain.
- If someone else reads it in the future, they can understand it quickly.

Short Explanation for Teacher:
Both my messy and clean programs do the same thing, but the clean one is easier to read and understand. I improved the variable names, added comments, and gave better feedback to the user. The clean version looks more professional, while the messy version looks like a beginner’s first try.
